## Education
### Undergrad
**BSc in Computer Science from Sabanci University (January 2023)**

I was influenced a lot by the programming languages course I took.

My graduation project was on collecting cyber security related data and classifying them. First, I collected cyber security-related Telegram messages from public groups and worked on their classification. Then, I collected phishing data and trained an NLP model to determine the brand and sector of phishing from the HTML.

**Minor in Philosophy of Science**

Reading, thinking and discussing about open science is how my interest in open-source started.

## Work
I have been developing the mobile app of [upcarta](https://www.upcarta.com/) for a year now. We use Flutter.

## Interests
**Programming languages:** Rust, Go and Elixir are very tempting all the time.

**Natural languages:** I am conversational in Persian, in the process of forgetting Swedish and German. I will start learning a new one once I am satisfied with my Persian.

<!-- ## Languages
### Beginner Rust
I have enjoyed no language more than Rust.
The language is great, but the ecosystem around it makes it unbeatable.

### C++ Appreciator
While Rust has largely replaced C++ in my life, I still respect and admire it.

### Begrudging Pythonier
Python is great for quick problems and scripts but nothing too substantial.
Developement speed is rarely worth the headaches small typos can cause. -->
