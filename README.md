## Education
### Undergrad
BSc in Computer Science from Sabanci University (January 2023). The programming languages course started it all.
Minor in Philosophy of Science. This is how my interest in open-source started.

## Work
I have been developing the mobile app of [upcarta](https://www.upcarta.com/) for a year now. We use Flutter.

## Interests
**Programming languages:** Rust, Go and Elixir are very tempting all the time.
**Natural languages:** I am conversational in Persian, in the process of forgetting Swedish and German. I will start learning a new one once I am satisfied with my Persian.

<!-- ## Languages
### Beginner Rust
I have enjoyed no language more than Rust.
The language is great, but the ecosystem around it makes it unbeatable.

### C++ Appreciator
While Rust has largely replaced C++ in my life, I still respect and admire it.

### Begrudging Pythonier
Python is great for quick problems and scripts but nothing too substantial.
Developement speed is rarely worth the headaches small typos can cause. -->
